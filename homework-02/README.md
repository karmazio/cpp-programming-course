# Homework #2: [Movement semantics and lambda expressions]

## Task description
BigData class with the following functionality:

1) Constructor, copy constructor, copy operator, move constructor and move operator.

2) Function that returns a BigData object (by value) to demonstrate the movement operation.

3) Logs (output to the console) in each constructor/destructor/operator to see when the object is copied and when it is moved.

4) Lambda expression that captures any STL container you like by reference. It also accepts a specific value as a parameter, by which it increases each element of this container.
