## Technical solutions
The system should contain the database that will include all the information about the participants of the system as well as the history of the purchases that were made within the system. 

The system should be equiped with a service to store and show various media such as images and videofiles. 

The movie object should have various attributes that can be used to filter the search by the user and to create a suggestions based on the user's preferences.
